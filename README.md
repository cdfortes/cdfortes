### Hi there 👋👋🏾! 😁

My name is Carlos Fortes, I'm from [Cabo Verde](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=lm&q=cabo+verde+mapa&atb=v224-1&ia=web&iaxm=about&iax=images) (🇨🇻) - I've been working as Developer (Backend, Frontend) since 2008 and currently (since 2016) at [UTIC](https://github.com/uticathon) - Finance Ministry of Cabo Verde where I'm working with Liferay, ReactJS and other stuff.

Always looking for a new opportunity to learn! As a programmer, I'm in a constant search for better practices and also experimenting new things.

- I’m currently working on a project with ReactJS (work)
- I’m learning NextJS and Strapi (side project)
- I'm looking to collaborate on social impact projects


In my free time I like to have fun with my children (😄),  to watch soccer (⚽️), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚) and to listen to music (🎵).
